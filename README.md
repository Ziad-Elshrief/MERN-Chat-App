# Real Time Chat App

Real time chat app with rooms that use Node.js and Express server.
The server serves a React frontend as a static folder and both can communicate using socket.io.
Using a modern responsive Tailwind styled frontend, you can join a room by entering a username and the room name you want to join.
Once you join a room, a chat box gets displayed where you can send messages that arrive to each user in this room.
